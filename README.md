# Planets-of-Mystery
An old game I wrote in FreeBasic.

The game is distributed without any sounds.  I used an old FMod sound engine to power the sounds, which is now incompatible with
today's FreeBasic.  I did not use FMod Studio, which
requires the following attribution: 

Made using FMOD Studio by Firelight Technologies Pty Ltd.

I also didn't have the FMod logo in the beginning, as, as far as I know, it wasn't required at the time.
Projects using FMod Studio do require the display of the logo as part of the attribution requirements.

Again, I did not use FMod Studio, simply a small FMod.dll file, whose license requirements were different in the early 2010s.
